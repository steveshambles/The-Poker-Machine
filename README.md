# The-Poker-Machine
A full GUI video poker machine for Windows and Linux written in Python.


This still needs some work on it to make it more playable, like sound fx,
a better way of reporting the result of the hand, i.e not using a message box,
a game log recording every hand and try excepts, etc.

The code leaves a lot to be desired as I am still learning.
